### 7 Things You Should Know About TOR

The article, written by Cooper Quintin, details 7 facts about TOR (and subsequently discredits common misconceptions):

1. **It still works**. With proper operational security, it is still possible to remain anonymous using TOR.
2. **It's not just used by criminals**. People trying to avoid censorship, journalists doing research and organisations communicating securely are all examples of TOR users.
3. **TOR does not have a military backdoor**. TOR is open-source, and several audits of the software have not displayed possibilities of a backdoor.
4. **No-one in the US has been prosecuted for running a TOR relay**. Whilst legislation differs between countries, according to the publisher's knowwledge there have been no public cases.
5. **TOR is easy to use**. The software comes with a pre-configured browser reminiscent of clearnet browsers.
6. **TOR is not as slow as you think**. Whilst slower than a regular internet connection, the developers have improved the speed to be much faster than it has traditionally been.
7. **TOR is not foolproof**. Going back to point 1., proper operational security is needed. If the user is reckless they can be identified, so taking some basic steps such as using the TOR browser or Tails is useful.
