Threat modelling is a process in which a system is analysed in order to determine its strengths & weaknesses commonly used in cybersecurity. It is a process recommended to be included in the initial design phase of a system in order for security to be built-in from the beginning, though continous repetion is advised to 
keep security up to date.

In threat modelling, there are **4** key questions which, through the process of being answered, provide a framework towards creating a secure system:
  1. What are we working on?
  2. What can go wrong?
  3. What are we going to do about it?
  4. Did we do a good enough job?

Here are some methods provided by the OWASP Foundation on how to answer these questions:

1. To effectively conduct threat modelling, one must first understand the system they are working with. Visualising the system using methods such as
   **DFD**s (data flow diagrams) or brainstorming with stakeholders are useful in providing understanding of the particular ins and outs of a system.
   
2. Identifying threats and risks can be done in numerous ways, but a popular one is a process developed by Microsoft employees called **STRIDE**, which stands for
   * **S**poofing **-** Impersonating someone in order to gain access to a system
   * **T**ampering **-** Unauthorised modification to data
   * **R**epudiation **-** Denying responsibility for an action by removing evidence
   * **I**nformation Disclosure **-** Unathorised extraction of confidential data
   * **D**enial of Service **-** Loss of ability to use service due to excessive failed log-in attempts
   * **E**levation of Privileges **-** Unauthorised promotion of user's role to gain more access in system via newly acquired privileges
