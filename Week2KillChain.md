# Kill  Chain

## X) Document Summary - Intelligence Driven Computer Network Defense
In this document, employees at Lockheed Martin's analyse a major change in cybersecurity attack patterns and showcase
effective methods to counter it.

Previously, a majority of corporations relied on technologies and processess originally intended to mitigate the risk of legacy methods of cyber attacks such as
automated viruses & worms. However, a new class of threats called APT or Advanced Persistent Threat began to emerge, and previous methods of deterring cyber attacks were
no long viable against these APT-intrusions. The threat actors perpetrating these APT attacks would attempt intrusion after intrusion, adjusting their operations based on the success
or faliure of each attempt, meaning the previous common doctrine, which was the equivalent of putting up a digital wall, was not sufficient anymore if attackers could simply go around the wall.

These aforementioned threat actors would not be deterred by anti-virus software or quick patches, and they would often target end users directly with the ultimate goal of obtaining
sensitive intellectual property. One method of attack was using so-called "zero-day" exploits. These are previously unknown structural weaknesses in software that can not be effectively mitigated as their existence is unknown to the defending party. However, if analysts couldn't account for what they didn't know, they could prepare for what they knew: the attacker's next step.

This is where the Kill Chain Model comes in. Analysts devised an effective model of the necessary steps an attacker needs to make to gain access to a computer network.
Here's Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain:

 1. Reconnaisance - Harvesting email addresses, conference information etc.
 2. Weaponisation - Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
 3. Delivery - Delivering weaponised bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
 4. Exploitation - Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a victim's system
 5. Installation - Installing malware on the asset
 6. Command & Control (AKA C2) - Command channel for remote manipulation of the victim
 7. Actions on Objectives - With 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals
