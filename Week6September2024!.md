I had actually already read and summarised this chapter for the course's third week's homework! Here's what I wrote then:
One-Way functions:

A one-way function would be something like  func(x) = x

It is easy to understand the output when you have the input, but the reverse is much harder.  

While one-way functions are not protocols, many commonly used protocols used in modern cryptography utilise one-way functions, such as:
- Trapdoor one-way function: special type of one-way function with a secret trapdoor. If you know the secret, you can easily compute the function in reverse.
- A one-way hash function: function that takes a variable length input string (called a pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (generally smaller) output string (called a has value)

The point of a hash function is to fingerprint an image; To produce a value that indicates whether a candidate pre-image is likely to be the same as the real pre-image.


The latter part of the chapter provides methods of creating authentic digital signatures:
- A symmetric cryptosystem & an arbitrator
- Public key cryptography
- Digital Signature Trees - used in bitcoin!
- public key cryptography + one-way hash functions
