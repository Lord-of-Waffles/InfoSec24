## b)

No interwebs, no connections

Ping is a command that tracks the time it takes to send and receive a packet to a server. In this case, I pinged Google's DNS server and it took 329ms to send and receive a packet. 8.8.8.8 is their public IPv4 address.
It's pretty easy to determine from the error message why I couldn't ping to the server without a connection, I wasn't on tht internet (big mass of networks), therefore there was no way to connect to the specified address since it was not a local address.
